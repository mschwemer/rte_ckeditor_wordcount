# CKEditor Add-On "wordcount" for TYPO3

This repository provides the add-on "wordcount" as a extension for TYPO3.

The reason for this extension is to provide a nearly complete example (aka prove of concept) for my blog post at
 https://typo3worx.eu
 
Since TYPO3 version 9LTS this plugin is part of the TYPO3 core, so you do not need to add it as a custom plugin, but 
just require it in your editor configuration.
